Workspace for use when developing on your own computer

Note: for most members, using this workspace is not strictly needed. It can be effective to use to set up the workspace, and contain pip requirements. However, it was mainly made by me (Wesley Fisher) to do development in a docker virtual environment, which is not needed by others. It can be a useful reference to see what installation steps are done on a new machine, but otherwise isn't needed.
