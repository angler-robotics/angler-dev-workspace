# Docker Setup

## For Ubuntu OS

### Docker Engine

Follow the install instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). You should have a docker version above 19.03 installed.

### NVidia

(From `https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/`).

Follow the instructions from [this page](https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/)

Then, run:
- `apt-get install nvidia-container-runtime`
- check that the following command succeeds with `which nvidia-container-runtime-hook`
- `sudo service docker restart`

## For Windows

### GUI Setup

To be able to view things through Docker (gazebo, etc), follow the setup [here](https://jack-kawell.com/2019/09/11/setting-up-ros-in-windows-through-docker/)


## Both OS's

### Creating the Docker Container

After the above, you can open a command line, navigate to the `docker` directory, and run the command `make` (if it's not available on Windows, copy the command in Makefile under `base:`).

### Running the Docker Container

Open a command line (bash (Ubuntu) or Powershell (Windows)) and navigate to the repo directory. `Run the start_docker_[OS].x` script. This should start a container. You can do this in additional terminals to connect to the same container as well.
In case you encounter 'running scripts is disabled on this system' error, for windows follow the [top answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4037939/powershell-says-execution-of-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system)
# Testing Commands

For debugging issues in running containers, here are some commands you can use. Enter these from the command line.

1. `ping 8.8.8.8` can help test out the internet connection
2. `xeyes` can test out the gui connection of the container. You should see a pair of eyes following your mouse as it moves.
3. `glxgears` can test if the container can access your graphics card. This should fail on a Ubuntu computer without a GPU (probably), but may still work on a Windows machine, which may not support GPUS at at the moment.
